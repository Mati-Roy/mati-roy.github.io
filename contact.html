  <h1>Contact policy</h1>
  <p>Call me only if it's time-sensitive or if you've scheduled it in advance.</p>

  <p>If what you have to tell me might interest others, I prefer if you <b>write to me publicly</b>. You can contact me on my public groups/pages or anywhere on the web: just tag me or send me the URL.
    Sending a URL by email is the best for more time sensitive communication. Commenting on <a href="/writings.html">my posts</a> can also be a good way to communicate with me.
  </p>

  <p>To contact me privately, I'm more likely to reply rapidly and not forget about your request if you communicate by emailing me. 

  <p>If we work on a project together, I often like to <b>communicate in a Google Doc</b>.</p>

  <p>You can shedule a video-chat or in person meeting by email and/or Google Calendar. Let me know if you're open in livestreaming our call.</p>

  <p><b>I appreciate feedback</b>.</p> 

  <p><b>I'm interested in alternative forms of communication</b>, so let me know if you have atypical preferences or
    want to experiment with something.</p>

  <p>I'm also on various other platforms, and am open to try others. Let me know if you have a preference for another
    platform.</p>
