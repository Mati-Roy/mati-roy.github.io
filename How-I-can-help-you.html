    following.

  <h2 id="Outsourcing">Outsourcing</h2>
  <p>I have outsourced thousands of hours of tasks. There's probably <a href="writings/How-to-buy-attention.html">more
      you can
      outsource than you're aware</a>. Let's discuss what can be taken off-your plate!</p>

  <h2 id="Productivity_coaching">Productivity coaching</h2>
  <p>In my experience, there are levels of productivity you only know exist once you've reached them. Most people have a
    lot of unknown unknown ways in which they could improve substantially on that front.</p>

  <h2 id="Project_management">Project management</h2>
  <p>I have a lot of <a href="/resume.html">professional experience</a> doing project management. I can help review your
    project planification, forecasting, and workflow, the communication with your team, and more!</p>

  <h2 id="Programming">Programming</h2>
  <p>I have a lot of <a href="/resume.html">professional experience</a> doing web programming and data analyses. Let me
    know if you would like me to review or debug your code.</p>

  <h2 id="Exploring_beliefs">Exploring beliefs</h2>
  <p>
    I can help you introspect and explore your belief structure for one of your cherished beliefs, and help
    disentangling
    beliefs from values. I use a collaborative approach to help you figure out why you believe what you believe, which
    can be particularly enlightening if you have beliefs you're (strongly) emotionally attached to. I can also play the
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/02/write-your-hypothetical-apostasy.html">devil
      advocate</a> on any ideas, and help you become your own devil advocate.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Life_debugging">Life debugging</h2>
  <p>
    If you have a problem in your life (minor or major, weird or cliché, recurrent or one time), I can try to help you
    figure out a solution. I have read and experimented with various applied rationality techniques, and generally have
    a solution oriented mindset, and am good at finding new potential solutions.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Mediation">Mediation</h2>
  <p>
    If you and someone else (/other people) have a conflict, and would like someone to mediate a discussion, I can help.
    Whether it's among company founders, romantic partners, family members, or any other situations. Depending on the
    exact situation, I think I'm in the 1st-5th percentile.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Financial_independence">Financial independence</h2>
  <p>One of <a href="/readings.html">my 3 reading recommendations</a> is on this. I have a lot of experience helping
    people cut their expenses, and invest money. I can help you plan your financial independence sooner
    than you
    thought possible.</p>

  <h2 id="Lifelogging_set-up">Lifelogging set-up</h2>
  <p>One of <a href="/readings.html">my 3 reading recommendations</a> is on this. Lifelogging can range from
    periodically backing up your social media information to fully video recording your life (and more)! I have written
    an <a href="/How-I-audio-video-record-my-life.html">introduction on how you can do it</a>, but there's a lot more to
    it!</p>

  <h2 id="Cryonics_consultation">Cryonics consultation</h2>
  <p>
    I have been invovled a lot with the <a href="resume.html#Biostasis_involvement">cryonics community</a>.
    If you have questions about cryonics, wonder if cryonics is good for you, or would like help signing up, or talking
    about it to a family member, I can help you with that. If you think you can't sign up for any reason (ie. location,
    budget, etc.), there's a decent chance I can find a solution. But the sooner you prepare, the more likely it'll work
    out.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Reading_suggestions_on_effective_altruism">Reading suggestions on effective altruism</h2>
  <p>
    If you would like to learn more about effective altruism, especially topics related to longtermism, or you have some
    questions on the topics, I might be able to refer you to relevant resources. I have listed some introductory
    recommendations in the <a href="readings.html">Readings</a> section.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Learning_to_edit_wikis">Learning to edit wikis</h2>
  <p>
    There's a lot of tools I could teach (some of which I mentioned on <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiroy/">LinkedIn</a>), but I'm singleling this one out because I think it's a
    particularly useful public good :) I can show you:
    <ul>
      <li>How to edit Wikipedia</li>
      <li>Which wikis complement Wikipedia</li>
      <li>How to prioritize which articles to edit</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
