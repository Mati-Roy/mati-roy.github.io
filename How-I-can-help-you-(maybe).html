<h1>How I can help you (maybe)</h1>


<p>
Here I list some ways in which I might be able to help you. If you think I could help you in other ways, let me know.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Exploring beliefs</strong>
</p>
<p>
I can help you introspect and explore your belief structure for one of your cherished belief, and help disentangling beliefs from values. I use a collaborative approach to help you figure out why you believe what you believe, which can be particularly enlightening if you have beliefs you're (strongly) emotionally attached to. This can take 5-30 minutes depending how deep you want to explore, and on the complexity of the topics. I'm still iterating on my approach; insight are not guaranteed ^_^.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Life debugging</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you have a problem in your life (minor or major, weird or cliché, recurrent or one time), I can try to help you figure out a solution. I have read and experimented with various applied rationality techniques, and generally have a solution oriented mindset.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Mediation</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you and someone else (/other people) have a problem, and would like someone to mediate a discussion, I can help. I don't have a lot of experience in that regard, but I think I'm okay at it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Devil advocate</strong>
</p>
<p>
I'm usually good to come up with arguments on various sides of various topics, and I generally think people's views are not nuanced enough. If you want to pass your idea to the test, let me know. And I can also help you learn to become your own devil advocate which is ultimately really useful to improve one's model of the world.

</p>
<p>
<strong>Cryonics consultation</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you have questions about cryonics, wonder if cryonics is good for you, or would like help signing up, I can help you with that. I have read and written a lot about cryonics, have visited many cryonics organizations, and haven't met around a hundred cryonicists. I think my position is pretty nuanced.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Reading suggestions on effective altruism</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you would like to learn more about effective altruism or some particular cause areas, or you have some questions on the topics, I might be able to refer you to relevant resources.
