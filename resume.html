  <h3>Pantask</h3>
  <p>
    Since 2019, I’ve been running a company to provide virtual assistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Send us any task at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ask@pantask.com">ask@pantask.com</a>, and if we can’t do it,
    we’ll give you 2
    hours of free virtual assistant time. You can also schedule a chat with me to see how we can best help you: <a
      target="_blank" href="https://calendly.com/mati-roy/60min">https://calendly.com/mati-roy/60min</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our team consists of 14 low cost assistants from the Philippines / Ukraine to help with tasks such as web searches
    and data entry, 13 people from the Effective Altruist / Rationalist community to help with various tasks such as
    brain debugging, as well as 4 programmers. We’ve offered a few thousand hours of services so far. For more
    information, check out: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vLYcJ8iSvVrhE1Wl5WE6OEhzwwkQMP-P2E5n9qzcqRI/">Our services</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Ought</h3>
  <p>
    I was contracted as an experiment participant for Ought in August 2019, but a month later was promotted to
    experiment runner, and I stayed in that role until the end of the experiments in January 2020.
  </p>
  <p>
    My main responsibility was to manage a team of ~50 participants to test Factored Cognition — Ought's approach to
    answering open-ended questions. This included working on:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Onboarding participants

    <li>Tracking features and bugs

    <li>Creating experiments (writing scripts, coordinating participants, etc.)

    <li>Improving experiments (increasing speed, improving robustness, etc.)

    <li>Guiding the strategy development to stress test our incentive structure

    <li>Improving the incentive structure of our platform

    <li>Managing our communication channels, and organizing our documentation
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Here’s more information on our research project: <a target="_blank"

  <h3>Effective Altruism Québec (EAQ)</h3>
  <p>
    Here’s our website: <a target="_blank"
      href="http://altruismeefficacequebec.org/">http://altruismeefficacequebec.org/</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    My main responsibility was to promote and teach effective altruism, and to help effective altruists in their
    projects and career choices. This included:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Organizing events: talks, discussions, social events, reading groups, study groups

    <li>Giving talks

    <li>Advising students making career decisions

    <li>Coordinating interns and volunteers

    <li>Onboarding new organizers

    <li>Maintaining finance; registering a non-profit

    <li>Recruiting new members; maintaining a CRM sheet

    <li>Supporting people with projects related to effective altruism, notably
      <ul>

        <li>Helping with organizing the <a target="_blank" href="https://aisafetyunconference.info/">AI Safety
            Unconference</a>

        <li>Doing prioritization research to recommend a CA$1 million donation by one of our members interested in
          empowering humans in poor countries

        <li>Documenting EA resources in French
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    During my time as the Effective Altruism Québec (EAQ) organizer, I was also the main organizer in adjacent
    communities, includying
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://macroscopehouse.com/">The Macroscope</a>, an EA / rationalist sharehouse (with
      17 habitants at
      its peak)

    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/less.wrong.montreal/">LessWrong Montréal</a>

    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.meetup.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Ethics/">Montreal AI Ethics</a>

    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://matiroy.com/communities.html">Other</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Outside EAQ, I have also helped with various EA projects. I was the interim manager of RAISE (Road to AI Safety
    Excellence) for a few months, which had the goal to develop an AI safety online course. I also helped for various
    small projects like the Effective Altruism Group Directory, and the EA Project 4 Awesome fundraiser. I'm also an
    admin and moderator on various online EA groups.

  <h2 id="Programmer">Programmer</h2>


  <p>
    During my physics engineering undergraduate degree, I did a full time intership (see: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3LNRGk0wixM3kyUE9ULUJtOU0/view">report</a>, <a target="_blank"
      href="https://robot.gmc.ulaval.ca/recherche/theme-de-recherche/robots-mobiles/plateforme-robotique-bioloid/">videos</a>)
    and then part time work at the
    university’s robotics lab.
  </p>
  <p>
    After that, I worked as a programmer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medfarsolutions.com/en_ca/">MEDFAR
      Clinical
      Solutions</a> for a year, then another year at <a target="_blank" href="https://leger360.com/">Léger</a>, and then
    I
    continued working as an independent contractor, as well as on my own projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Technologies/tools I used include Typescript, ReactJS, FluxJS, JSX, JQuery, HTML5, CSS, T-SQL, MySQL, C#, .NET,
    NodeJS, Python, R, IIS, git, JIRA.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m also very good with Google Sheets, and have developed Apps Scripts (ie. macro) to automate some tasks on them,
    and know how to use AirTable as well. I’ve also done some Wordpress development, and have worked with Shopify.
  </p>
  <h3>Machine learning</h3>
  <p>
    I only have a bit of experience in machine learning, but I know some of the general concepts and am familiar with
    the general AI strategy landscape.
  </p>
  <p>
    I did my undergraduate final project in machine learning: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N5PCQ7IuLeITZQEw3dCtfqCKKq79StCDp-puwDvs39A/edit?usp=sharing">Étude de
      la popularité d’articles en fonction de leur titre à l’aide de techniques d’apprentissage machine</a>. I was
    predicting news articles’ popularity
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>by analyzing various characteristics of the title such as length, keywords, punctuation and use of numbers,

    <li>using various algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers, logistic regression,

    <li>using Python and the following libraries: SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, and tkinter
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Biostasis_involvement">Biostasis involvement</h2>


  <p>
    I’m a director on the board of Critical Care Research.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started a local cryonics education group: <a target="_blank" href="http://cryoquebec.org/">CryoQuébec</a>, and
    hosted some
    discussions on the topic. I’ve also been offering free cryonics consultations to many people considering signing up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was contracted by Vipul Naik to create a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_cryonics">timeline on brain preservation</a>, which can be
    consulted here. This is the most comprehensive timeline on cryonics, and one of the most comprehensive and viewed
    timeline on the Timelines Wiki.
  </p>
  <p>
    During summer 2018, I visited all 5 cryonics service providers in the US, I visited some of the research centers,
    and visited cryonics local groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    I assisted to the Teens and Twenties Cryonics Gathering in 2018, 2019 and 2020, and I’m now a “replacement in
    training” to organize this annual event.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve talked with hundreds of cryonicists, including many researchers, employees, or otherwise key people in the
    cryonics community.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve <a href="https://matiroy.com/writings.html">written about biostasis</a>, and I also participate on various
    online groups.

  <p>
    I was a member of the Official Response Team of the <a target="_blank" href="https://goodjudgment.com/">Good
      Judgement</a> Project
    2.0 FOCUS research program organized by
    IARPA to improve forecasting counterfactuals in uncontrolled settings.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/100542/">58 prediciton on 34
      question on
      Metaculus</a>, and I have made <a target="_blank" href="https://predictionbook.com/users/Mathieu_Roy">82
      predictions on
      Predictionbook</a>. I have played calibration games and regularly make predictions. Here are <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17cbdGM0CmVO1MouVy6ol6flp8ofp2uyQ3s8_jmima-c/">predictions I made in
