    I'm running a company to provide virtual assistance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Send us any task at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:ask@pantask.com">ask@pantask.com</a>, and if we can’t do it,

  <h3>MEDFAR Clinical Solutions <i class="date">(Aug. 2015 – Sept. 2016)</i></h3>
  <p>While I was mostly a programmer at MEDFAR, it was a small company, so I had other roles. One of them was to put in
    place the technical support system, which included taking care of: the FAQ, the call center, Zendesk, documentation,
    schedules, SQL scripts, training, support logs, support dashboard using Google Sheet & App Script.</p>


  <h2 id="Programmer">Programmer</h2>

  <h3>Robotics <i class="date">(May 2011 – July 2012)</i></h3>
  <p>
    During my physics engineering undergraduate degree, I did a full time internship (see: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0By3LNRGk0wixM3kyUE9ULUJtOU0/view">report</a>, <a target="_blank"
      href="https://robot.gmc.ulaval.ca/recherche/theme-de-recherche/robots-mobiles/plateforme-robotique-bioloid/">videos</a>)
    and then part time work at the
    university’s robotics lab. Here are various tasks I did during my time at the lab:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Created a directory of robots with the Bioloid® robot platform</li>
    <li>Created a fast prototyping method with this platform</li>
    <li>Participated in the Canadian Undergraduate Physics Conference in Saskatchewan</li>
    <li>Made slideshows of everything that was done at the laboratory</li>
    <li>Developed a robotic arm on a turntable that controls its speed and acceleration in C</li>
    <li>Gave 10 workshops on LEGO® Mindstorms, and participate to a competition</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>General <i class="date">(Aug. 2015 – Oct. 2020)</i></h3>
  <p>
    After that, I worked as a programmer at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.medfarsolutions.com/en_ca/">MEDFAR
      Clinical
      Solutions</a> for a year, then another year at <a target="_blank" href="https://leger360.com/">Léger</a>, and then
    I continued working as an independent contractor, as well as on my own projects. Notably, I’ve worked as a
    contractor for <a target="_blank" href="https://elaboration.ai/">Elaboration Language Labs</a> and <a
      target="_blank" href="http://epidemicforecasting.org/">Epidemic Forecasting</a> (<a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/epidemics/covid">code</a>), and lauch a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://covid19immunehelp.com/">website with
      opportunities for COVID-19 survivors</a> and created a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://github.com/benjaminroy/Health-Extension/">browser extension to maintain healthy habits</a>, through
    which I continued doing web development and data analyses.
  </p>

  <h3>MEDFAR Clinical Solutions <i class="date">(Aug. 2015 – Sept. 2016)</i></h3>
  <p>Here's a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORWof0sjTAA">video of the web application we
      developed at MEDFAR</a>. I was one of the main developers working on the front end of the new version of the
    application. I also compared various frameworks to help the CTO make a decision: ReactJS, AngularJS 1, BackboneJS
    and RequireJS. I did data mining with PhantomJS in C#. I created various reports and reporting tools, using tools
    like T-SQL, iTextSharp in ASP.NET, and SiSense and Tableau. I also created integrations and interfaces with
    other software, such as laboratories and hospital information systems.
  </p>

  <h3>Léger <i class="date">(Sept. 2016 – Sept. 2017)</i></h3>
  <p>
    At Léger, I developed the new front end version of the Customer Interaction Management web app mostly by myself —
    see <a target="_blank"
      href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwAldu_yH8QtNjk5LW12WlU3WVk/view?usp=sharing">video</a>. I
    co-supervised an intern that helped me on this application for a few months. I also developed the new Survey Engine
    by myself —
    see:
    <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BwAldu_yH8QtN1NnMnk0LUpUYTg">video for the mobile
      version</a>, and <a target="_blank"
      href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwAldu_yH8Qtckd2RUhfdDBsMnc/view?usp=sharing">video for the
      desktop version</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Technologies/tools</h3>
  <p>
    Technologies/tools I used include Typescript, ReactJS, FluxJS, JSX, JQuery, HTML5, CSS, LessJS T-SQL, MySQL, PL/SQL,
    C#, .NET, NodeJS, PhP, WordPress, Foundation, Bootstrap, Kendo UI, Python, R, Matlab, Maple, IIS, git, JIRA, LaTex.
    I've also used the following, but less: MongoDB, C++, Java, Assembly (ARM). I've used various IDE, including Visual
    Studio, Atom, PyCharm, and Eclipse. I've used various OS and virtualisation tools.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m very good with Google Sheets, and have developed Apps Scripts (ie. macro) to automate some tasks on them,
    and also know how to use AirTable well. I’ve also done Wordpress development, and have worked with <a
      target="_blank" href="https://shop.covid19immunehelp.com/">Shopify</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>Machine learning</h3>
  <p>
    I have limited experience in machine learning, but I know the general concepts and am deeply familiar with the
    general AI strategy landscape. I’ve also done the Coursera course <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">Neural Networks
      and Deep Learning</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    During a university course, I created an AI that plays Four in a Row in Prolog. I did my undergraduate final project
    in machine learning: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1N5PCQ7IuLeITZQEw3dCtfqCKKq79StCDp-puwDvs39A/edit?usp=sharing">Studying
      the popularity of news articles in function of their title using machine learning techniques</a>. The aim of this
    project was to predict news articles’ popularity by:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Analyzing various characteristics of the title such as length, keywords, punctuation and use of numbers,

    <li>Using various algorithms: k-Nearest Neighbors, decision trees, naive Bayes classifiers, logistic regression,

    <li>Using Python and the following libraries: SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib, and tkinter
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="Biostasis_involvement">Biostasis involvement</h2>
  <p>
    I’m a director on the board of Critical Care Research since 2019-12-11.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started a local cryonics education group: <a target="_blank" href="http://cryoquebec.org/">CryoQuébec</a>, and
    hosted some
    discussions on the topic. I’ve also been offering free cryonics consultations to many people considering signing up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was contracted by Vipul Naik to create a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_cryonics">timeline on brain preservation</a>, which can be
    consulted here. This is the most comprehensive timeline on cryonics, and one of the most comprehensive and viewed
    timeline on the Timelines Wiki.
  </p>
  <p>
    During summer 2018, I visited all 5 cryonics service providers in the US, I visited some of the research centers,
    and visited cryonics local groups.
  </p>
  <p>
    I assisted to the Teens and Twenties Cryonics Gathering in 2018, 2019 and 2020, and I’m now a “replacement in
    training” to organize this annual event.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve talked with hundreds of cryonicists, including many researchers, employees, or otherwise key people in the
    cryonics community.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’ve <a href="https://matiroy.com/writings.html">written about biostasis</a>, and I also participate on various
    online groups. I created a <a href="http://lessdead.com/">blog</a> and a <a
      href="http://wiki.lessdead.com/">wiki</a> on the topic.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also involved in the lifelogging community.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Forecaster">Forecaster</h2>
  <p>
    I was a member of the Official Response Team of the <a target="_blank" href="https://goodjudgment.com/">Good
      Judgement</a> Project
    2.0 FOCUS research program organized by
    IARPA to improve forecasting counterfactuals in uncontrolled settings. I also received pay-for-performance
    compensation for my participation in <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cLtdcxu9E4noRSons">amplification experiments</a> by <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.foretold.io/">Foretold</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have made <a target="_blank" href="https://www.metaculus.com/accounts/profile/100542/">58 predictions on 34
      questions on
      Metaculus</a>, and I have made <a target="_blank" href="https://predictionbook.com/users/Mathieu_Roy">82
      predictions on
      PredictionBook</a>. I have played calibration games and regularly make predictions. Here are <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17cbdGM0CmVO1MouVy6ol6flp8ofp2uyQ3s8_jmima-c/">predictions I made in
