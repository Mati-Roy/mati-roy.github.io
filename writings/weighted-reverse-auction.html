            <h1>Weighted reverse auction</h1>


            <p class="subtitle">a fair way to assign shared tasks
            </p>
            <h2>Context</h2>


            <p>
                I have the impression this method can work well to split tasks among a group of 4-15 trustworthy people.
            </p>
            <h2>Reverse auction</h2>


            <p>
                Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_auction">Wikipedia page</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                1) <strong>Bid</strong>. Everyone writes a price for which they would be indifferent between doing the
                task or paying someone else to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
                2) <strong>Select person</strong>. The person with the lowest bid does the task.
            </p>
            <p>
                3) <strong>Select price</strong>. Take the lowest bid.
            </p>
            <p>
                This method assumes everyone will accomplish the task equally well. See next section if this assumption
                is false or undetermined.
            </p>
            <h2>Weighted reverse auction</h2>


            <p>
                <strong>Assumption</strong>. Group of honest people (otherwise this breaks down in some ways).
            </p>
            <p>
                1) <strong>Bid</strong>. Everyone writes a price for which they would be indifferent between doing the
                task or paying someone else as competent as them to do the task.
            </p>
            <p>

                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Extension</span>: Someone from outside the group could also
                bid, but the money will be paid by the people inside the group in either case, and external bidder don’t
                participate
            </p>
            <p>
                2) <strong>Evaluate capacity</strong>. People attribute number to everyone representing the fraction of
                the price they would be ready to pay the best person to do the task according to them.
            </p>
            <p>

                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Details</span>: One can be ready to pay more someone if they
                are: trustworthy, reliable, competent, or otherwise in a better position to accomplish the task, or have
                indirect reasons why they would be a valuable person to accomplish the task (ex.: train them).
            </p>
            <p>

                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example</span>: If you’d be ready to pay someone 50% less than
                the best person because you think they’ll do a worse job, then you assign them a weight of 0.5.
                Assigning a value of 0 implies that you wouldn’t want that person to do the job even for arbitrarily
                small cost.
            </p>
            <p>

                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Variable</span>: The weight can also be anonymized.
            </p>
            <p>

                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Variable</span>: If some people don’t put their evaluation, you
                can either default to the average or to 1.
            </p>
            <p>

                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Extension</span>: If someone opts out of the bidding, their bid
                is set at infinity, and their weight not counted.
            </p>
            <p>
                3) <strong>Aggregate competence evaluation</strong>. Everyone averages out the number they received from
                everyone else.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Alternatives</span>: multiply the numbers; take the logarithmic
                average; take the median
            </p>
            <p>
                4) <strong>Calculate competence-adjusted bid</strong>. Everyone divides their price (1) by the average
                people valued them at (3).
            </p>
            <p>
                5) <strong>Select person</strong>. The person with the lowest number at (4) does the task.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Details</span>: If there’s a tie, the person can randomly be
                selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                6) <strong>Select price</strong>. Take the lowest bid
            </p>
            <p>
                7) <strong>Split the cost</strong>. Split the cost equally between all housemates, including among the
                person that will do the task.
            </p>
            <h2>Alternatives / Extensions</h2>


            <p>
                <strong>Alternative</strong>: Everyone bids, then people vote for someone.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Extension</strong>: If someone in a group really doesn’t benefit from a task, they can opt-out.
                Otherwise, we should try to reach consensus on task selection.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Extension</strong>: If two people want to work on a task, the two lowest bid can do the task at
                the second lowest bid.
            </p>
            <h2>Addendum</h2>


            <p>
                <strong>Edge case</strong>: There are some specific cases where some people might disagree with the
                split, but I think this would happen rarely, and when it does, a combination of people might need to do
                the task.
            </p>
            <p>

                <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Example</span>: Some people might need to pay someone more than
                they would have been ready to be paid, and personally disagree that the person is more competent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Norm</strong>: Give the benefit of the doubt; put 1 to new housemates; (except for
                responsibility that are public facing, like finding new housemates, in which case it’s better if a long
                term tenant aware with the house does it).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Norm</strong>: Fund should be kept in a separate account or the account of a trusted tenant; but
                the rest of the finance responsibility can be done by anyone.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Platform</strong>: We use <a href="https://www.splitwise.com/">Splitwise</a> to track our
                finance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Previous version</strong>: We first tried with the weight for oneself being 1 and adjusted
                other’s weights accordingly, but this overweight some people’s preferences.
            </p>
