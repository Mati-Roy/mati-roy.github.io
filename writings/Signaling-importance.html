    <em>How can you signal that something is important?</em>
  </p>
  <p>
    In this piece, I briefly review ways people signal importance in the culture surrounding me and mention some of
    their limitations when applicable. I also suggest new <span class="color2">cultural elements</span> (sections in
    <span class="color2">blue</span> are about those â€” feel
    free to skip to them).

  <h2 id="Categories">Categories</h2>


  <p>
    I tried organizing different types of signaling in categories. Some relevant features I used:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Innate vs cultural
      <ul>

        <li>Innate: born with / genetics

        <li>Cultural: designed by humans
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>Artificially limited vs naturally limited
      <ul>

        <li>Artificially limited: the signal is useful because itâ€™s not abused, not because it couldnâ€™t

        <li>Naturally limited: the signal cannot (easily) be abused
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>Natural vs artificial
      <ul>

        <li>Natural: the signal is sent while trying to achieve the object-level goal
          <ul>

            <li>Ex.: by using money and time toward achieving the goal
            </li>
          </ul>

        <li>Artificial: the signal is sent as a separate action from trying to chive the object-level goal
          <ul>

            <li>Ex.: by betting money that achieving a goal will have been useful
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Innate">Innate</h2>


  <h3 id="Emotions">Emotions</h3>


  <p>
    How a person seems to be feeling communicates how important they find something.
  </p>
  <p>
    Limitations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>It helps knowing a person well to know whatâ€™s their baseline emotional variance.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Artificially-limited">Artificially limited</h2>


  <p>
    You can create an attencedent for communicating in a certain way only when itâ€™s important.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Use-qualifiers">Use qualifiers</h3>


  <p>
    You can simply say how important you think something is. This is arguably the most straightforward signal.
  </p>
  <p>
    Limitation:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>If you donâ€™t know someone very well, you donâ€™t know how alarmist they are. It can be hard to have a good sense
      of how important they think something is.
      <ul>

        <li>(inb4: someone is bound to signal how socially good they are by saying this is never a problem for them
          ðŸ¤·)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Maintain-a-central-list" class="color2">Maintain a central list</h3>


  <p>
    I have a centralized list of <a href="https://matiroy.com/writings.html">~all my published writings</a> as well as
    a
    list of <a href="https://matiroy.com/readings.html">my recommended readings</a> with a number out of 10
    representing
    its importance. That way, the qualifiers are operationalized (ish) and the ratings are centralized, so itâ€™s easy
    for
    anyone to have a glimpse at how I use the qualifiers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Limitation:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Importance might vary for different people.
      <ul>

        <li>Although it shouldnâ€™t be that long to make different ratings for specific people.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Note: This is also useful for people to rapidly see what your top recommendations are.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note: If you have one, Iâ€™d be curious to see it :)
  </p>
  <h3 id="Create-low-volume-channels" class="color2">Create low volume channels</h3>


  <p>
    For example, I have a mailing list for high value information. On my website I write:
  </p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    Subscribe to <a target="_blank" href="http://eepurl.com/hkYh_z">my mailing list</a> to receive information I find
    very valuable.
    So far, since 2019-10-02, I've sent <a target="_blank"
      href="https://us20.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=a40712d533b2cb9c141cdd726&id=8d1eebe353">0 emails</a>. I plan to
    continue sending few as I value your attention.
  </div>
  <p>
    I also created a Facebook group where people can post at most once per year: <a
      href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/onceperyear">You can only post once per year</a>. Its description is:
  </p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    You can post at most once per calendar year. The idea is to only share important information. If you could only
    tell us one thing per year, what would it be?
  </div>
  <p>
    Limitation:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>It has to be broadcasted to a group of people.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Naturally-limited,-valuable-outside-of-signaling">Naturally limited, valuable outside of signaling</h2>


  <p>
    Some resources are both useful in themselves and of limited quantity. So if you use them, or even just destroy
    them
    to signal that something is important, it will be a credible signal.
  </p>
  <h3 id="Use-money">Use money</h3>


  <p>
    Limitation:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Itâ€™s not always natural.
      <ul>

        <li>Example when itâ€™s natural: You offer to pay for someoneâ€™s cryopreservation.

        <li>Example when itâ€™s not natural: You pay someone to exercise.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>Itâ€™s expensive.

    <li>Some people might not want your money if they care about you and act paternalisticly.
      <ul>

        <li>Although you can also use bets.
          <ul>

            <li>But some bets are hard to operationalize.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>You need to know how much money the person has to know how important it is to them.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Use-actions">Use actions</h3>


  <p>
    Limitations:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Itâ€™s not always natural.
      <ul>

        <li>Example when itâ€™s natural: You think itâ€™s important for someone to know about something, so you teach
          them.

        <li>Example when itâ€™s not natural: You go tell something to someone in person instead of through a video call
          to
          signal that itâ€™s important, even though a call would have suffice to convey the object-level information.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>It takes time.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="Naturally-limited,-valuable-mostly-for-signaling">Naturally limited, valuable mostly for signaling</h2>


  <h3 id="Get-permanent-tattoos">Get permanent tattoos</h3>


  <p>
    Rationale:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Your body has a limited surface: you can only put so much information on it.

    <li>You cannot easily change your body for another one.

    <li>Your body is important to you.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    So information on it can signal high importance. Although to the point that it can sometimes be seen as
    fanaticism.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also artificially limit it: you donâ€™t have to use your whole-body. If you only have one tattoo about one
    thing, then it will appear more important than if you have many tattoos about many things.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: Tattoos can have other uses, such as:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Artistic

    <li>Practical
      <ul>

        <li>Ex.: <a target="_blank" href="https://hpluspedia.org/images/8/88/Cryonics_tatoo.jpg">Communicate what to
            do
            in case of
            death</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>Commitment device
      <ul>

        <li>Ex.: To a romantic partner
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="Signal-participation" class="color2">Signal participation</h4>


  <p>
    To distinguish people that donâ€™t have tattoos because they are squeamish or otherwise donâ€™t want tattoos for some
    reasons, from people that just havenâ€™t had anything sufficiently important to communicate so far, people could get
    a
    minimalist tattoo. This way, the absence of other tattoos would now communicate that this person has a high bar
    for
    important information or otherwise never had anything sufficiently important to say.
  </p>
  <p>
    To avoid confounding the tattoo with something done for the purpose of being artsy, the tattoo should arguably not
    be artsy.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make this signal more obvious, it would help to make it more known â€” so arguably people should use the same
    tattoo to communicate this.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ideas:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>A black dot on the forehead

    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://tattoodo-mobile-app.imgix.net/images/news_uploads/legacy/0/31775.jpg">Lines
        on
        your cheecks</a>

    <li>A black dot on your thumb
      <ul>

        <li>So that itâ€™s visible when you shake hand
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>A ring around the index of your strongest hand
      <ul>

        <li>Also signals your strongest hand
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>A black dot on your bottom lip, in the center

    <li>A black dot on your right wrist
      <ul>

        <li>Where stamps often goes when you go to a paid event
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>A black circle with a black dot behind your ears

    <li>A black dot in the back of your neck

    <li><a target="_blank"
        href="https://tattoodo-mobile-app.imgix.net/images/news_uploads/legacy/0/31781.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress">A
        black circle in your back</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Post-on-highly-visible-and-limited-real-estate">Post on highly visible and limited real-estate</h3>


  <p>
    There are other highly visible places where you can communicate a limited message, and so signals importance when
    you do.
  </p>
  <p>
    For examples:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>T-shirt with a message

    <li>Facebook frame on your profile picture

    <li>Facebook cover picture

    <li>Facebook bio
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="Cut-your-hair" class="color2">Cut your hair</h3>


  <p>
    Similarly to tattoos, your capacity to cut your hair is limited (to how fast it grows).
  </p>
  <p>
    Distinctions with tattoos:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>It signals importance over months to years instead of oneâ€™s whole biological life

    <li>Itâ€™s not entangled with the message: Cutting your hair signals importance, but it needs to be attached to a
      message that is not communicated with your body.
      <ul>

        <li>This can be useful in some situations; for example:
          <ul>

            <li>If itâ€™s a private message

            <li>If you donâ€™t want people to think youâ€™re signaling something else to other people
              <ul>

                <li>Ex.: If you recommend an expensive medical treatment to your family, you might not want to tell
                  other people as otherwise it will be less clear whether youâ€™re doing that mostly to appear like a
                  person that cares about their family rather than mostly for being someone that cares about their
                  family
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <li>But in other situations, this can be undesirable:
          <ul>

            <li>Having the message on you in order to broadcast it continuously can be useful if itâ€™s a message you
              want
              to bring awareness to

            <li>With hair, only people that were there when you cut them can know what message was attached to it (or
              at
              least youâ€™d need to show them a video)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Limitations:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Hair is used to signal other information
      <ul>

        <li>More on the topic: <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_hair">Long hair â€”
            Wikipedia</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>Hair length is also chosen for aestetic purposes

    <li>Maximum length and growth speed varies from person to person
    </li>
  </ul>
