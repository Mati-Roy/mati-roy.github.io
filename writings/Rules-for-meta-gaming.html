  <h1>Rules for meta-gaming</h1>


  <p>
    <strong>Self-contained commitments and deceptions</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In most games, I really enjoy what being able to commit to certain course of actions unlock. Commitments can include
    commitments to help in exchange for certain actions (alliances) and commitments to retaliate if some actions is or
    to attack if some actions isn’t taken (threats). I also like allowing for deceptive behavior.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, I want games to remain self-contained. That means reference to outside the game world during the game (ex.:
    real life threats), and commitments or group strategizing outside (ie. before) a game are forbidden (ex.: saying you
    won’t lie during the game before the game<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>).
  </p>
  <p>
    As for inter-game commitments (ex.: if you kill me this game, I’ll attack you next game), I think I prefer to forbid
    them as well. But I’m open to trying various options here, including allowing inter-game commitments during one day
    or inter-game commitments for a specific game.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Breaking strategies</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In strategy games, I like when players find loopholes to win or tie, or other strategies that break the game. Those
    can be patched for the next games, but I think finding a winning loophole definitely deserves winning a game.
  </p>
  <p>
    For party games, I think respecting the spirit of the rule makes more sense though.

          Betting real world reputation would make your in-game threats and alliances much more believable and therefore
          stronger.&nbsp;<a href="#fnref1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
