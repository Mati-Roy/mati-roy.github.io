  <h2><strong>Bounty</strong></h2>


  <p>
    <strong>Bounty: 3,500 USD</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I'm offering 2,000 USD</strong> for someone I end up consensually being a legal parent with who you‚Äôve
    introduced me to and who wasn‚Äôt already a prospect. If someone reached out to me as a result of you sharing my
    profile on social media, that counts too. Paid only for my first child.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>My good friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AltonSun">Alton</a> offered an additional
      1,000
      USD</strong> to support me ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äì ze said:
  </p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p>
      I'll add $1000 to the bounty for the referral of someone who is with you and brings you a lot of joy for 18+
      months
      because I love celebrating love. I'd want to have the option to have a 2 hour call with you both at that time
      window
      as a strong preference but not necessary.

    A few more notes:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Introductions can be done through <a href="https://matiroy.com/contact.html">any channel</a>.</strong>

    <li>I can stop taking new submissions for this bounty at any time (but, obviously, not retroactively).

    <li>The money is to incentivize you to take the time to read my profile and recommend me to friends, and to
      generally reward superconnectors which I think tend to be undervalued. The money is just a bonus on top of the
      gratitude^_^

  <h2><strong>General</strong></h2>


  <p>
    While I‚Äôm open to other types of relationships, this profile is written with the goal of finding someone/people to
    raise children with. I'm 32 years old (born in October 1990).
  </p>
  <p hidden>
    I invite you to be yourself. I encourage you to not avoid doing anything you want to do in relation to me just
    "because it's weird".
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to use <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reciprocity.io/">Reciprocity</a target="_blank"> to see if we
    match, or just reach out to me
    directly.
  </p>
  <p>
    There‚Äôs some information I like to have about prospects early on that might be easier to do in a survey format, or
    at least just so you know some specific explicit questions I generally have, you can see my <a target="_blank"
      href="https://forms.gle/KJCdvAFTWSMeE6wq8">Date me survey</a>. Feel free to be very explicit and to the point with
    me (or not). You can send me your own questions.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I measure 188 cm (6'2)</strong> and weigh 87.1 kg (192 lbs).
      </p>
      <h2 hidden><strong>Relationship structure and attraction</strong></h2>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm open to various structures, although I prefer if most of the relationship energy goes towards the family.
      </p>
      <p>
        I‚Äôm panromantic. I‚Äôm generally much more sexually attracted towards females. Romantic and sexual attraction is a
        plus.
      </p>
      <h2><strong>Relationship</strong></h2>


      <p>
        <strong>I would like a partner with whom I can connect deeply</strong>, know each other very well and develop
        great models of each other, share about what's going on in our lives, and be open about our internal
        experiences. Provide support in each other's goals and aspirations, have each other's back, and deeply trust
        each other, and care about each other. Giving each other's affection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Be a team working together</strong>. Defaulting to assuming any issues that might arise isn't being done
        maliciously, and being comfortable bringing them up and collaboratively working on them. Being resilient, and
        working hard to address any potential issues. Trying hard to not split / live separately while raising children.
        Ideally being open to being lifelong partners, and if distance (emotional, physical, etc.) became wanted, still
        remain there for each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spending time together</strong>. In terms of spending time together, I might lean towards spending a bit
        less time together than the median couple. I like spending time with a partner by working on common projects,
        talking about our day, cuddling, messing around, sharing meals, and doing exercise / sports. I
        don‚Äôt like to go out regularly, but maybe it‚Äôs because I just haven‚Äôt found the right activities.
      </p>
      <h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>


      <p>
        <strong>Reviews</strong>. I‚Äôve had <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiroy">some reviews</a
          target="_blank"> which I think
        are relevant here. I also had a very public relationship with <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.facebook.com/carissalorraine">Carissa</a>, so checking our posts could give you some peak
        into what being with me is like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Values</strong>. I‚Äôm a very principled person. Honesty is very important for me. In terms of moral
        philosophy, I‚Äôm leaning towards deontological-threshold negative preference-weighted life utilitarianism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Communication style</strong>. <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vs3kzjLhbdKsndnBy/ask-and-guess">I lean ask/tell culture. I‚Äôm rather
          good at guess culture</a>, and like using it sometimes, but it‚Äôs important to me that my partner is able to
        make their needs known explicitly if I fail at reading them, and be okay with me doing the same. I want someone
        that is open to receiving feedback ‚Äî I personally love feedback. I strongly dislike ‚Äúdeny culture‚Äù ‚Äî where
        someone says something that I need to deny, instead of asking me. I‚Äôm leaning more towards <a target="_blank"
          href="https://knowingless.com/2021/11/13/cold-and-warm-cultures/">cold culture</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fun</strong>. I like adventures and challenges. Not that I do those a lot, but I love them when I do.
        Illustrative examples: I find it exhilarating to sleep naked in a cold forest, and I love doing DIY Impractical
        Jokers (<a target="_blank"

        generally like going
        out of my comfort zone and trying new things. I like roleplaying. I like creating things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Vibe</strong>. I'm often told I have a calming effect. I can inhabit other vibes, but I often inhabit
        that one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Habits</strong>. I don‚Äôt drink alcohol. I don‚Äôt smoke. I don‚Äôt take any drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Knowledge </strong>(outside profession). I‚Äôve read a fair amount about topics related to economics,
        moral philosophy, futurism, effective altruism, LessWrong, rationality, and transhumanism.

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>More</strong>. To know more about me, I invite you to go the traditional route ‚Äì ie. stalking me; wait,
        no, I mean 1 on 1 interactions :P. You can easily stalk me though; I notably have a lot on Facebook and on my

        to let me know other information you would like me to include on this profile.
      </p>
      <h2><strong>Location</strong></h2>


      <p>
        I have a medium preference to work towards a US citizenship (ie. I‚Äôm Canadian).
      </p>
      <p>
        I would prefer to live in Central or North America longterm, but short-term I'm more flexible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm totally okay with meeting remotely. I can also easily travel around, and will be travelling in the US
        starting in April.
      </p>
      <h2><strong>Children</strong></h2>


      <section>
        <h3><strong>Genetic code and surrogate parents</strong></h3>

        <p>I would like to have children using embryo/gamete selection. Can I pitch you the idea? It'll be a fun conversation if nothing else^_^
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm fertile: I‚Äôve done a
           <a target="_blank" href="https://coda.io/@mati-roy/sperm-donor-profile/fertility-20">semen analysis and
          donated sperm leading to 3 live births</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I‚Äôm also open to using surrogates ‚Äî I think it could actually be valuable to have 2 (or more) children at a time.
        </p>
      </section>
      <h3><strong>Number</strong></h3>


      <p>
        <strong>I want at least 2-4 children</strong>, but my desire for the number of children scales almost linearly
        with wealth, so I would like it if having 6+ children was on the table.
      </p>
      <h3><strong>Upbringing</strong></h3>


      <p hidden>
        I would like to share responsibilities ~equally related to taking care of our children (money, time, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to have an au pair, nanny, and/or live-in maid, unless we‚Äôre more than 2 parents / adults raising
        our children.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a predisposition towards liking giving a lot of autonomy / independence / responsibilities to children.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it makes sense to give children the option to homeschool if/when they seem sufficiently
        autonomous and if/when we have the capacity to support that. I can also see traditional schooling, boarding
        schools, and other options being more valuable depending on our situation. I care about providing the tools for
        our children to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like I record all my life,<strong> I would like to record all the life of our children</strong>, at least
        in some ways at least until they can make their own decision (because I think this might be important for <a
          target="_blank"
          href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k8mwvvvpjMGcZLAKH/the-case-for-lifelogging-as-life-extension">identity
          preservation</a>, as well as useful for <a
          href="https://matiroy.com/writings/Should-I-record-my-life.html">other reasons</a>).<strong> I would like to
          sign up our children for <a target="_blank" href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html">cryonics</a
            target="_blank">.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I would like our children to learn English as a first language.</strong> I might speak to them in French
        so they also know French.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don‚Äôt mind whether you or our children eat animal products, at least until they can make their own choices
        (I‚Äôm just mentionning that in case you know I have an <a target="_blank"
          href="https://coda.io/d/Mati-userguide_d3kSIiPo-tN/Ethical-market-pressure_sudFK#_luNzW">bivalvegan diet</a>
        and you were wondering).
      </p>
      <h2><strong>Finances</strong></h2>


      <p>
        You can see my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> for information on my career.
      </p>
      <p hidden>
        I often think in terms of ROI when I spend money. I like saving a lot because of the <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/07/15/two-fun-tools-from-the-mmm-software-department/">power of
          compounding investments</a>.
      </p>
      <h2><strong>Personality I‚Äôm interested in</strong></h2>


      <p>
        (Which also corresponds to my personality.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Main traits I generally like (sort of in order):
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Honest

        <li>Values living

        <li>Truth-seeking; self-reflective

        <li>Productive

        <li>Emotionally stable; regulate their anger

        <li>Mentally healthy, low addiction

        <li>Intelligent

        <li>Longtermist

        <li>Transparent

        <li>Caring

        <li>Prosocial

        <li>Confident
        </li>
      </ul>
