  <h1>My dating profile</h1>

  <p>

    <strong><u>Tl;dr</u>: Read only what‚Äôs in bold</strong>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Bounty</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Bounty: 3,500 USD</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I'm offering 2,000 USD</strong> for someone I end up having a child with (ie. being a legal parent with
    them; a sperm donation wouldn‚Äôt count) that you‚Äôve introduced me to and who wasn‚Äôt already a prospect. If someone
    reached out to me as a result of you sharing my profile on social media, that counts too. Paid only for the first
    child I have, and after a month of existence.
  </p>
  <p><strong>My good friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AltonSun">Alton</a> offered an additional
      1,000
      USD</strong> to support me
    ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äì ze said:
  </p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p>
      I'll add $1000 to the bounty for the referral of someone who is with you and brings you a lot of
      joy for 18+
      months
      because I love celebrating love. I'd want to have the option to have a 2 hour call with you both at that time
      window
      as a strong preference but not necessary.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p><strong>My friend <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tolicodes">Toli</a> also offered an additional
      500
      USD</strong> to support me
    ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚Äì ze said:
  </p>
  <div class="blockquote">
    <p>
      I will 50% match that bounty ($500) with the same conditions üôÇ I don't know Mati *that well* (yet). But very much
      interested in seeing him find a partner and taking apart how he did it
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>Here's <a target="_blank" href="http://tolidates.com/">Toli's own bountified dating profile</a> (with a much larger
    bounty ^_^).
  </p>
  <p>A few more notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Introductions can be done through any channel, such as <a target="_blank"
          href="https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09">Facebook</a> or email
        (mathieu.roy.37@gmail.com).</strong>
    <li>I can stop taking new applicants for this bounty at any time (but, obviously, not retroactively).

    <li>The money is to incentivize you to take the time to read my profile and recommend me to friends, and to
      generally reward superconnectors which I think tend to be undervalued. The money is just a bonus on top of the
      gratitude^_^
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>General</h2>
  <p>
    No need to read (all) my profile to reach out to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    While I‚Äôm open to other types of relationships, this profile is written with the goal of finding someone to
    raise
    children with. I'm 31 years old (born in October 1990), and generally prefer closer to my age, but +/- 13 years
    is
    fine.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I first started writing this, it turned out I first wrote <a
      href="https://matiroy.com/writings/My-life-plan.html">My current lifeplan</a>. I think it‚Äôs very relevant to
    this,
    but I‚Äôll be including relevant information directly here.
  </p>
  <h2>Looks</h2>
  <p>
    <center> <img style="width: 49%" src="../images/1.jpg" /><img style="width: 37%" src="../images/profile_face.jpg" />
    </center>
    <p>
      A lot of dating profiles start with pictures, so I suppose that‚Äôs important for most people, so here are some
      pictures: <strong><a target="_blank"
          href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLW4zMfwi7otDN4T7">https://photos.app.goo.gl/kLW4zMfwi7otDN4T7</a></strong>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>I measure 188 cm (6'2).</strong> I just weighted myself, and I was at 93.6 kg (206 lbs).</p>

    <p>
      I'm mostly attracted towards personalities. My only physical preference worth mentionning is
      that
      I‚Äôm attracted to people that look healthy. I generally prefer no (or little or artistic) makeup, but I don‚Äôt
      really
      mind.
    </p>


  </p>
  <h2>On getting to know each other</h2>
  <p>
    We can, but don't have to "go on dates". You can also just reach out to me because I seem interesting, and not
    force
    anything specific.
  </p>
  <p>I'm also into <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mati.roy.09/posts/10159949015054579">live-in
      culture</a>: I think it's an efficient way to get to know someone to live with them very early on for a
    pre-determined amount of
    time (with the option to bail out at any point of course, and none of the usual expectations most people might
    have
    about living together) ‚Äì this is not at all needed if you're not into that; it's
    just an option.
  </p>
  <p>I invite you to be yourself. I encourage to not avoid doing anything you want to do in relation with me just
    "because it's weird".</p>

  <h2>
    Relationship
  </h2>
  <p>
    <strong>I would like a partner with whom I can connect deeply</strong>, know each other very well and develop
    great
    models of each other, share about what's going on in our lives, and be open about our internal experiences.
    Provide
    support in each
    other's goals and aspirations, have each other's back, and deeply trust each other, and care about each other.
    Giving each other's affection. <strong>Be a team working together.</strong> Defaulting to assuming any issues
    that
    might arise isn't
    being done maliciously, and being comfortable bringing them up and collaboratively working on them. Being
    resilient,
    and working hard to address any potential issue. Trying hard to not split / live separately while raising
    children.
    Ideally being open to being lifelong partners, and if distance (emotional, physical, etc.) became wanted, still
    remain there for each other.
  </p>
  <h2>Location</h2>


  <p>
    <strong>I have a rather strong preference to work towards a US citizenship</strong> (which would require living
    in
    the US unless I marry a US-American, in which case it wouldn‚Äôt be necessary).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I would prefer to live in Central or North America longterm, but short-term I'm more flexible.</strong>
  </p>
  <p><strong>I'm totally okay with meeting remotely. I can also easily travel around</strong> ‚Äì so if I travel to
    your
    city and
    it doesn't seem like a good match after our first meeting / date, that's totally fine.</p>

  <h2>Relationship structure, romance, and sex</h2>


  <p>
    <strong>Summary: Flexible</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm not promiscuous. I‚Äôve had close friends with whom I've liked to cuddle. I care about safe sex a lot. I‚Äôm
    panromantic, although I experience it differently with males and females. I‚Äôm more sexually attracted towards
    females in general. I tend to like to escalate slowly. Also, I wish this was the default, but I'm not sure it
    is,
    but it's obviously important to me that sex be enjoyable by all involved parties.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would prefer to raise children with someone I‚Äôm romantically and sexually attracted too, but I‚Äôm also open to
    raising children with a platonic friend. I want to live under the same roof.
  </p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm open to a few possible structures.
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>I‚Äôm open to monogamy.

    <li>I‚Äôm open to a close Vee or triad (in which case some of the descriptions in this profile would need to be
      adjusted).

    <li>I‚Äôm open to having some openness that‚Äôs well defined.

    <li>I‚Äôm open to complete openness, but if we continue to have sex I would like it to be safe.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p hidden>
    While here I‚Äôm looking for 1-2 people to share parenting responsibility equally, I‚Äôm also open to having less
    responsibility (although I imagine few people would want that).
  </p>

  <h2>Children</h2>


  <h3>Genetic code</h3>


  <p>
    <strong>I‚Äôm open to using our own genetic code</strong> to create our children. I‚Äôm fertile (I‚Äôve done a
    spermogram
    and got a person pregnant through a sperm donation).
  </p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm also open to using sperm and/or egg donation from people that have the following traits (to be discussed to
    integrate your own preferences in this model) to an extent we find more satisfactory than our own (and/or if
    you‚Äôre
    not fertile):
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Desire to live

    <li>Rational

    <li>Executive capabilities

    <li>Prosocial

    <li>Intelligent

    <li>Hard working

    <li>Mentally healthy

    <li>Longtermist

    <li>Similar communication style
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I‚Äôve described some of those traits in more detail in the section ‚ÄúPersonality I‚Äôm interested in‚Äù.
  </p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôm also open to using surrogate mothers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I don‚Äôt want to adopt.
  </p>
  <h3>Number</h3>


  <p>
    <strong>I want at least 2 children</strong>; my desire for number of<strong> </strong>children scales almost
    linearly with wealth, but I‚Äôm flexible.
  </p>
  <h3>Upbringing</h3>

  I'm flexible on this, we can discuss this together of course, but here are some of my thoughts.

  <p>
    <strong>I want to have a parenting approach that is</strong> <strong>time-efficient</strong>:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>I have started reading about strategies such as how to sleep train and potty train babies early

    <li>I would like to have an au pair / nanny / live-in maid (although we're a triad or Vee, we could have a
      stay-at-home parent)

    <li>I have a predisposition towards liking giving a lot of autonomy to children

    <li hidden>I still intend to use my time to mentor my/our children in ways that can‚Äôt easily be delegated

    <li hidden>I also obviously will still maintain a relationship with my/our children of course
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>I would like to share responsibilities ~equally related to taking care of our children.</strong> <span
      hidden>(I mean, it could
      also be more, but I would generally assume they would expect me to do half of the work as well)</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I don‚Äôt have a strong preference between</strong> <strong>homeschooling/unschooling them or
      not</strong>,
    but I think it
    makes sense to give them the option if they seem autonomous and we have the capacity to support that (which
    seems
    likely; at least one of us would work remotely or we would have an au pair or employee at home).
  </p>
  <p>
    Just like I record my life,<strong> I have a strong preference to</strong> <strong>record our children
    </strong>at
    least in some ways at least until they can make their own decision (because I think this might be important for
    <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/k8mwvvvpjMGcZLAKH/the-case-for-lifelogging-as-life-extension">identity
      preservation</a>, as well as useful for <a href="https://matiroy.com/writings/Should-I-record-my-life.html">other
      reasons</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>I would like our children to learn English as a first language</strong>. I might speak to them in French
    so
    they also know French.
  </p>
  <p><strong>I would like to sign up our children for <a target="_blank"
        href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/cryonics.html">cryonics</a>.</strong></p>
  <p>
    While I eat an <a target="_blank"
      href="https://coda.io/d/Mati-userguide_d3kSIiPo-tN/Ethical-market-pressure_sudFK#_luNzW">ostrovegan diet</a>,
    I
    don‚Äôt have much of a preference for what you or our children eat, at least until they can make their own
    choices.
  </p>
  <h2>Wealth </h2>


  <h3>Finances</h3>
  <p>
    I would like my partner and I to <strong>maintain some separate finances, but also have some joint
      finances</strong>
    for joint
    expenses, notably for our children.
  </p>
  <p>
    I would like a partner that is <strong>financially capable</strong> of generally supporting their share of
    mutual
    expenses, but, naturally, if someone is wealthier, this will provide positive externalities to the other person
    (as
    they might want to buy communal things the other person wouldn't want)
  </p>
  <p>
    Beside expenses to save time, I'm generally pretty frugal, but I'm willing to be flexible on this. I like saving
    a
    lot because of the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/07/15/two-fun-tools-from-the-mmm-software-department/">power of
      compounding investments</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    If a person contributes more in some non-financial ways (ex.: bearing a child, doing housework), then I think it
    can
    make sense for the other person to pay for their share of those.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a good income (ref. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiroy/">LinkedIn
      profile</a target="_blank">) and aiming to make more money through entrepreneurship. My spendings have been
    pretty
    low,
    so
    I was able to put an important fraction of it aside, and I'm near a minimal level of financial independence.</p>

  <h2>Personality I‚Äôm interested in</h2>


  <p>
    <strong><em>Which also corresponds to my personality.</em></strong>
  </p>
  <h3>Main traits</h3>


  <p>
    <strong>Honest</strong>. Honesty is very important to me ‚Äî at least meta-honest: being honest about your
    honesty.
    I
    would prefer someone that would never say literal false information with the intent to deceive to a partner /
    me.
    I‚Äôm extremely honest.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Values living</strong>. I will connect fundamentally more with someone that values living. I would like
    someone for whom the best possible life is of infinite length ‚Äî literally never ending, not just a very very
    large
    number or an ‚Äúinfinite life‚Äù from which they would eventually bail out. It‚Äôs okay if they would prefer death
    over
    some imperfect infinite lives, but not over the best possible one. No specific beliefs about the feasibility of
    this
    needed. I would also prefer someone that is not at risk of suicide (medical aid in dying doesn‚Äôt count).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Rational</strong>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Not</span> the na√Øve Spock version. But
    someone
    that is self reflective, not attached to their beliefs, passes cognitive reflections tests, dislikes
    self-deception,
    and prioritizes accuracy over political correctness (when communicating with me). I'd also include good
    self-knowledge here.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Good executive capabilities</strong>. I would like someone that at least answers their emails rapidly,
    doesn't forget
    their meetings, and generally has basic functional systems to operate in the world (such as to keep their
    kitchen
    and work office operational).
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Similar communication style</strong>. <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vs3kzjLhbdKsndnBy/ask-and-guess">I lean ask/tell culture. I‚Äôm rather
      good
      at
      guess culture</a>, and like using it sometimes, but it‚Äôs important to me that my partner is able to make their
    needs known explicitly if I fail at reading them, and be okay with me doing the same. I want someone that is
    open
    to
    receiving feedback ‚Äî I personally love feedback. I strongly dislike ‚Äúdeny culture‚Äù ‚Äî where someone says
    something
    that I need to deny, instead of asking me.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Inspiring</strong>. I‚Äôm influenced by my social environment, and I want to work hard and am ambitious.
    So
    I‚Äôm more inspired when living with hard working and/or ambitious and/or successful people. (Hardworking is also
    a
    valuable trait for taking care of our mutual responsibilities.)
  </p>
  <h3>Other traits</h3>


  <p>
    The traits above were the most important. Here I'm just adding other trait I have and value, but don't worry
    about
    them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Mentally healthy</strong>. Self explanatory. Low addictions would also be nice.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Longtermist</strong>. I value making decisions mostly in terms of their expected longterm consequences.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Intelligent</strong>. It's a spectrum.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Adventurous</strong>. I like someone that says yes to challenges. Finds it fun to sleep naked in a cold
    forest. Will do invisible improv and DIY <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=impractical+jokers">impractical jokers</a>. Etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Health-conscious</strong>. I‚Äôd rather someone that doesn‚Äôt smoke cigarettes. I would prefer someone (at
    least) leaning towards a healthy diet.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think I also like people that are <strong>transparent</strong>, <strong>kind</strong>,
    <strong>empathic</strong>,
    <strong>caring</strong>, <strong>prosocial</strong>, <strong>confident</strong> and able to <strong>regulate
      their anger</strong>.
  </p>
  <h2>More information about me</h2>


  <p>
    Here is other information I anticipate people might want to have about me (those are <span
      style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> things I‚Äôm necessarily looking for in others).
  </p>
  <p>
    I‚Äôve had some reviews on LinkedIn which I think are also relevant here: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiroy">https://www.linkedin.com/in/matiroy</a>. My LinkedIn profile also
    has
    information about my career, obviously.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other personality traits:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>I'm often told I have a calming effect

    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Habits:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>My sleep schedule is flexible, and I can likely generally sync it to yours if you have a preference (I‚Äôve
      lived
      with a friend for 5 months, about 4 of which were synced).

    <li>I tend to do exercise when I have someone with whom to do exercise. But my belief in the health benefits of
      exercise is not very strong.

    <li>I don‚Äôt drink alcohol. I don‚Äôt smoke. I don‚Äôt take any drugs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Knowledge (outside profession):
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>I‚Äôve read a fair amount about topics related to moral philosophy, futurism, effective altruism, LessWrong,
      and
      transhumanism.
    <li>I have good intuitions around economics.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Skills:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>I‚Äôm able to do most types of housework and (figure out) house repairs, but I generally prefer to outsource
      it

    <li>I‚Äôm pretty good at understanding social interactions / situations in details

    <li>I‚Äôm good at preventing and resolving conflicts

    <li>I‚Äôm good at thinking from first principles
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Other:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>I don‚Äôt really mind whether we have animal companions or not

    <li>I‚Äôm open to nudism, although I might not default to it

    <li>You can see my writings here: <a href="https://matiroy.com/writings.html">https://matiroy.com/writings.html</a>

    <li>You can see some services I offer here: <a
        href="https://matiroy.com/How-I-can-help-you.html">https://matiroy.com/How-I-can-help-you.html</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I‚Äôve had an OkCupid account for a very long time, and I‚Äôve answered many questions on it ‚Äî a bunch are probably
    not
    up-to-date, but you can check them out: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.okcupid.com/profile/1024227943072844142/">https://www.okcupid.com/profile/1024227943072844142/</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    To know more about me, I invite you to go the traditional route ‚Äì ie. stalking me; wait, no, I mean 1 on 1
    interactions :P. You can easily stalk me though; I notably have a lot of Facebook posts ‚Äì feel free to send a
    friend
    request.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can answer <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Y8OLa1vYSVIpnj13G-e2R8IogkNmRveZDX4dmmsIfy4/">this survey</a> to let me
