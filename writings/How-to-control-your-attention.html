    <strong>Summary</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of the general improvements I try to make is to:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Hide information of types I don’t want

    <li>Put content behind an action — avoid passively receiving content

    <li>Control what notifications I receive
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Browser extensions such as adblocks can often be useful for that.
  </p>
  <p>
    —
  </p>
  <p>
    The following sections and tools are put roughly in order of importance to me.
  </p>
  <h2>General</h2>


  <p>
    AdBlocks can generally be customized to filter any parts of the web you don’t want to see — not just ads, but also
    things like suggested content. For example, Paul Christiano uses it to << block "related content," "next stories,"
      the whole youtube sidebar, everything on Medium other than the article, the gmail sidebar, most comment sections,
      etc.>> (source: <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nW6S5QJmPLhWoagfH/ten-small-life-improvements">Ten small
        life improvements</a>).
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Example:</strong> <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">uBlock
        Origin</a>, <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adsremoved-adblocker-popu/cnjeigndamicmdckankknlipliiffchk">AdsRemoved</a>

    <li>Also, to remove cookie popups: <a href="http://prebake.eu/">http://prebake.eu/</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I also use Google Doc and bookmarks to note articles that I might want to read, instead of reading them now. When I
    check back on the list later, I often realize most of the articles shouldn’t be prioritized.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following are things I haven’t implemented myself, but can see being useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use the Chrome extension <a
      href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/delayed-gratification/ifhndomfnbmggdgodaicfebeggdphlcn?hl=en">Delayed
      Gratification</a> with a list of attention grabbing websites so that it will put a 15 seconds countdown before you
    see the website, hence making a more conscious decision about whether you want to consult the website.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can use the Chrome extension <a
      href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-wrangler/egnjhciaieeiiohknchakcodbpgjnchh?hl=en">Tab
      Wrangler</a> to “[a]utomatically [close] inactive tabs and [make] it easy to get them back”.
  </p>
  <h3>Measure</h3>


  <p>
    I use a time tracker to track where I spend my attention
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>Example.</strong> <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rescuetime-for-chrome-and/bdakmnplckeopfghnlpocafcepegjeap?hl=en">RescueTime</a>,
      Chrome extension.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Facebook</h2>


  <h3>Hide content</h3>


  <ul>

    <li>depending on your ethical views, consider installing an <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">AdBlock</a>*
      <ul>

        <li>also use the extension to block any parts you don’t like; notably, I suggest blocking suggested content in
          the right bar (see image)
          <p>

                Fixer for Facebook</a>: remove features you don’t want from Facebook such as comments and likes, and add
              new features such as hiding posts you’ve already seen and removing certain types of posts
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      type of notification)

    <li>turn off notifications from most of your groups (go to group you receive a -> click Notifications -> click Off)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Other</h3>


  <ul>

    <li>consider uninstalling the mobile Facebook app, and using it only on desktop, or at least only the webpage (at
      least turn off mobile notifications)

    <li>use <a href="https://www.messenger.com/">https://www.messenger.com/</a> instead of <a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a> when you want to chat

    <li>remove the prediction for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a>; type <a
        href="https://www.facebook.com/notifications">https://www.facebook.com/notifications</a> until it becomes the
      prediction
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Why?</strong> the Newsfeed can be distracting; be mindful about what you want to read)

        <li><strong>How? on mobile:</strong> when you type ‘f’ in your URL bar, touch and maintain the option, then
          you’ll have the option to remove this prediction)

        <li><strong>How? on desktop:</strong> when the wrong prediction is made, press Shift. + Del.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>remove the link from the browser home page
      <ul>

        <li><strong>How?</strong> on mobile: touch and maintain the option, then you’ll have the option to remove this
          prediction)

      </ul>

    <li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=blocking">block some features for some users</a>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Details</strong>: restrict some users, block some users, block messages from some users, block app
          invites from some users, block event invites from some users, block apps, block pages
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Other extensions I’m not using currently:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li><a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toolkit-for-fb-by-plugex/fcachklhcihfinmagjnlomehfdhndhep?hl=en-US">Toolkit
        For FB by PlugEx</a>: do a massive automated removal (ex.: friends, comments, likes, etc.); notably, you can
      unfollow all pages and groups (which is different from unlike / quitting a group; it just stops showing them in
      your feed) so that you can then follow only the few ones that provide useful content

    <li><a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-like-notifications/kbfakkkdllpodegeoggpfcmjabodhpca?hl=en-US">hide
        ‘Like’ notifications</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Extreme version</h3>


  <p>
    <strong>Requirement</strong>: having a good workflow with emails
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Facebook</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Unsubscribe to all notifications that you wouldn’t want to receive.

    <li>Install <a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-modifier/hcbgadmbdkiilgpifjgcakjehmafcjai?hl=en">Tab
        Modifier</a>, and change the name of the tab of any Facebook page to “Facebook” to hide notifications from
      showing up there

    <li>Use adblock to blocks all parts of Facebook you don’t like (like suggestions made by Facebook, but also
      notification counts), as well as the Messenger bar and icon

    <li>Select the feature to receive Facebook notifications by email.

    <li>Create additional filters on emails, to archive or organize less important notifications
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Example</strong>: I created filters to put notifications for reacts in a separate folder that
          doesn’t go in my Inbox

        <li><strong>Why?</strong> Some notifications can’t be turned off on Facebook
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Messenger</strong>
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>When receiving a Messenger email, ask the person’s email if you don’t have it, then forward the email to that
      person with the reply
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>YouTube</h2>


  <ul>

    <li>Remove Recommendations Youtube VK Facebook
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Details</strong>: option to block: right panel, home page, comments, playlist

        <li><strong>Example</strong>: Block YouTube recommended videos with this <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/remove-recommendations-yo/hfnghnjkcpgagjbiheidccjnneoipbmb?hl=en">Chrome
            extension</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Search Engines</h2>


  <p>
    This <a
      href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/block-site-website-blocke/eiimnmioipafcokbfikbljfdeojpcgbh/">Chrome
      extension</a> allows to hide a list of websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some websites you might want to block to control your attention are: click-baity websites, websites that require
    login, websites that blocks users with ad blockers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m hosting a list of websites blocking users with ad blockers. You’re welcome to use it, and contributions are
    appreciated.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Fun fact</strong>: this is essentially an ad blocker blocker blocker. It blocks websites that blocks users
    with ad blockers.
  </p>
  <h2>Emails</h2>


  <p>
    I try using only one inbox for all my emails, and maintain an Inbox 0 most of the time. I archive or snooze emails
    once read.
  </p>
  <p>
    I use the new Snooze feature if you want to be reminded about an email later.
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li><strong>How?</strong> In Gmail you can click on an email, and then on the clock logo, and select a time you want
      the email to reappear in your inbox. You can also see your snoozed emails by clicking on the Snooze option in the
      left menu.

    <li><strong>Alternatives. </strong>Google Keep’s Reminders and Google Calendar’s Reminders can also be used for that
      purpose.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I have a<strong> filter for newsletters </strong>(see image), at least if you’re subscribed to a lot of newsletters
    that you don’t always read and don’t judge important. I keep a Google Doc with a list of newsletters, and which I’ve
    read that I can consult when I want to catch up with some topics.
  </p>
  <p>


    <img class="img" src="../images/writings/How-to-control-your-attention-2.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip">

  </p>
  <p>
    I put<strong> events in Google Calendar</strong>, which I try to look just before and / or after going to bed. I
    also use Google Calendar notifications.
  </p>
  <p>
    I put<strong> tasks in a Google Doc </strong>(with specific next step and/or bottleneck if the task feel aversive,
    and group similar tasks to do them in series). I suggest having a reliable way to remind you to consult this list
    periodically.
  </p>
  <p>
    Following are things I haven’t implemented myself, but can see being useful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Quoting Paul Christiano on <strong>avoiding email inbox</strong>: << <em>I often need to write or look up emails
      during the day, which would sometimes lead me to read/respond to new emails and switch contexts. I've mostly fixed
      the problem by leaving gmail open to my list of starred emails rather than my inbox, ad-blocked the "Inbox (X)"
      notification, and pin gmail so that I can't see the "Inbox (X)" title. </em>>> (source: <a
        href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nW6S5QJmPLhWoagfH/ten-small-life-improvements">Ten small life
        improvements</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    Quoting unroll.me on <strong>facilitating unsubscribing</strong>: << <em>Instantly see a list of all your
      subscription emails. Unsubscribe easily from whatever you don't want.</em> >> (see: <a
        href="https://unroll.me/a/signup">https://unroll.me/a/signup</a>)
  </p>
  <p>
    boxbe has a few features. Quoting one on <strong>reducing unwanted emails</strong>
    << <em>Boxbe empowers you to choose which businesses and contacts can reach your inbox. Anybody who isn’t on your
      guest list is automatically asked to verify that they are an actual person. This means less spam for you. </em>>>
