<h1>How to control your attention on Facebook?</h1>


<p>
<em>If you don't decide what you want to read, Facebook will.</em>
</p>
<p>
Here are things you can do to control your attention on Facebook on the technology side (I'm writing something else to cover the social norms side) (in order of importance to me).
</p>
<h2>Hide content</h2>
<img src="../images/writings/How-to-control-your-attention-on-Facebook.png" alt="alt_text" title="image_tooltip">

<ul>

<li>depending on your ethical views, consider installing an <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm">AdBlock</a>* <ul>

 <li>also use the extension to block any parts you don't like; notably, I suggest blocking suggested content in the right bar (see image)</li> </ul>
</li> 

<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en">block your news feed</a>
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-fixer-for-facebook/ifmhoabcaeehkljcfclfiieohkohdgbb?hl=en">Social Fixer for Facebook</a>: remove features you don't want from Facebook such as comments and likes, and add new features such as hiding posts you've already seen and removing certain types of posts</li></ul>

<h2>Control notifications</h2>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=notifications">review your notifications settings</a>
<li>turn off other notifications (click on the '...' beside the notification -> select option to reduce or stop this type of notification)
<li>turn off notifications from most of your groups (go to group you receive a  -> click Notifications -> click Off)</li></ul>

<p>
<h2>Other</h2>
</p><ul>

<li>consider uninstalling the mobile Facebook app, and using it only on desktop, or at least only the webpage (at least turn off mobile notifications)
<li>use <a href="https://www.messenger.com/">https://www.messenger.com/</a> instead of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a> when you want to chat
<li>remove the prediction for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</a>; type <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notifications">https://www.facebook.com/notifications</a> until it becomes the prediction 
<ul>
 <li><strong>Why?</strong> the Newsfeed can be distracting; be mindful about what you want to read)
 <li><strong>How?</strong> on mobile: when you type 'f' in your URL bar, touch and maintain the option, then you'll have the option to remove this prediction)
</ul>
<li>remove the link from the browser home page 
<ul>
 <li><strong>How?</strong> on mobile: touch and maintain the option, then you'll have the option to remove this prediction)
</ul>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=blocking">block some features for some users</a> <ul>

 <li><strong>Details</strong>: restrict some users, block some users, block messages from some users, block app invites from some users, block event invites from some users, block apps, block pages</li> </ul>
</li> </ul>
</li> </ul>
</li> </ul>

<p>
Other extensions I'm not using currently:
</p><ul>

<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toolkit-for-fb-by-plugex/fcachklhcihfinmagjnlomehfdhndhep?hl=en-US">Toolkit For FB by PlugEx</a>: do a massive automated removal (ex.: friends, comments, likes, etc.); notably, you can unfollow all pages and groups (which is different from unlike / quitting a group; it just stops showing them in your feed) so that you can then follow only the few ones that provide useful content
<li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hide-like-notifications/kbfakkkdllpodegeoggpfcmjabodhpca?hl=en-US">hide 'Like' notifications</a></li></ul>

<p>
*<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/social-network-adblocker/dmgjckeibmdfndlflobjhddhmemajjld?hl=en">block only Facebook ads (instead of all ads)</a>
</p>
<h2>Extreme version</h2>


<p>
<strong>Requirement</strong>: having a good workflow with emails
</p>
<p>
<strong>Facebook</strong>
</p><ul>

<li>Unsubscribed to all notifications that you wouldn't want to receive.
<li>Install <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-modifier/hcbgadmbdkiilgpifjgcakjehmafcjai?hl=en">Tab Modifier</a>, and change the name of the tab of any Facebook page to "Facebook" to hide notifications from showing up there
<li>Use adblock to blocks all parts of Facebook you don't like (like suggestions made by Facebook, but also notification counts), as well as the Messenger bar and icon
<li>Select the feature to receive Facebook notifications by email.
<li>Create additional filters on emails, to archive or organize less important notifications <ul>

 <li><strong>Example</strong>: I created filters to put notifications for reacts in a separate folder that doesn't go in my Inbox
 <li><strong>Why?</strong> Some notifications can't be turned off on Facebook</li> </ul>
</li> </ul>

<p>
<strong>Messenger</strong>
</p><ul>

<li>When receiving a Messenger email, ask the person's email if you don't have it, then forward the email to that person with the reply
