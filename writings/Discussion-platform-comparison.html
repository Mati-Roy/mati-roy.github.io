<h2>Discussion platform comparison</h2>


<p>Reddit vs Facebook
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>


<p>
I'm undecided between Facebook and Reddit. Reddit seems better ranked by search engines and easier to get an overview of a group. But both have some important missing features.
</p>
<h2>Major pros from Facebook</h2>


<p>
<strong>Member filters</strong>. To know members from your city or members that are your friend. 
</p>
<h2>Major pros from both</h2>


<p>
<strong>Wiki</strong>. To share some common knowledge.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Open. </strong>No account is required if you just want to read.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Archivable</strong>. Can be archived on the <a href="https://archive.org/">wayback machine</a>.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Indexed</strong>. Search engines can give you the results.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note</strong>: But I prefer the wiki from Reddit. And Reddit seems to rank higher on search engines and more friendly to the Internet Archive.
</p>
<h2>Major cons from both</h2>


<p>
<strong>Data extraction</strong>. You can't (easily) download all your data (AFAICT).
</p>
<p>
<strong>Attention control</strong>. Not enough control on types of notifications.
</p>
<h2>Major con from Reddit</h2>


<p>
<strong>Closing posts</strong>. People can't comment or vote on posts after 6 months.
</p>
<h2>Incomplete</h2>


<p>
<strong>Search</strong>. Facebook has many search options to find a specific post. But it's easier to get an overview of Reddit posts as you can see the list of their titles, and order them in various ways.
</p>
<h2>Unsure</h2>


<p>
<strong>Real-name</strong>. Reddit doesn't have a "real-name" policy.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Infinite scroll</strong>. Reddit doesn't have an infinite scroll.
</p>
<h2>Minor pros</h2>


<p>
<strong>Reaction</strong>. The various reactions on Facebook is interesting. The downvoting on Reddit improve the quality of its posts.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Attention control</strong>. Reddit has less advertising (I think). Reddit has the possibility for admins to not have to approve members for a subreddit.
