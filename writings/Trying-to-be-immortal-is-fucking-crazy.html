<h1>Trying to be immortal is fucking crazy</h1>


<p>
Evolution hasn't selected for identity preservation. Your memories are constantly being overwritten, and your identity shifts as you age and your environment changes.
</p>
<p>
Accidents are always lurking. And even the best habits won't stop the aging process.
</p>
<p>
Cryonics is speculative and unreliable. And the complexity of aging is enormous.
</p>
<p>
Existentials risks are on all sides: if we don't go out on a bang, we might just go out on a whimper.
</p>
<p>
And those problems need to be solved by a bunch of monkeys who just invented the Internet.
</p>
<p>
On top of that, the incentive structure to solve those problems is deficient, and the incentive structure to solve the incentive structure isn't there either. We're fucked on all meta-levels.
</p>
<p>
Not counting the vast amount of demotivation, lack of caring, short-sightedness, learned helplessness, nihilist sentiments, and sheer destructive feelings. The desire to conform, the fear to change, and the lack of ambition.
</p>
<p>
And even if the few of us who care figure out all of it in time, we might just be playing a losing game. We might just be in a Universe that is inevitably destined to die no matter what.
</p>
<p>
With those stack against you, if you really think you can be truly immortal, you are really fucking crazy.
</p>
<p>
But still. If you don't try, you're just beyond crazy.
</p>
<p>
Immortality for All. At All Cost.
