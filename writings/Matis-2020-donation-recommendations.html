      recommendations on donating</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2021-11-16 Notes</strong>:
  </p>
  <p><strong>Tl;dr</strong>: If you're like "I don't want to read your post, but I want to donate to a charity for
    altruistic purposes now, just
    tell me where", then I suggest the <a href="https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/donate/organizations">Long-Term
      Future Fund</a>.</p>

  <p>The following is my recomendation for small donors (3-5 digits USD donations).</p>

  <p>In this post, I don't really bother backing up my recommenations very much because the rabbit holes are very deep,
    and the
    best explanations would depend on where you're at in your thinking. So for justifications on them, please ask me.
    You can also see some of <a href="../readings.html">my general recommended readings</a> which are
    good introductions to those topics.

    <strong>Other use of time</strong>
  </p>
  <p>Just as a quick note:
    <a target="_blank"
      href="https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/">Focusing on
      earning money might not be the best use of your time: other careers might be higher impact</a> — check out <a
      target="_blank" href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a>; they have written a lot on high-impact careers.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Use of money</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    When thinking about “where should I donate?”, we might think “which charity should I give to for altruistic
    reasons?”. But there are other ways to use money for altruistic purposes and there are other reasons to donate
    money.
  </p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
      </td>
      <td><strong>For altruistic reasons</strong>
      </td>
      <td><strong>For other reasons</strong>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="background-color: white;"><strong>Donating money</strong>
      </td>
      <td class="bgcolor2">

  <p>
    In this article, I want to focus on donations for altruistic reasons, but here are quick points on the other 3
    sections:
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong><span class="color1">Saving</span> <span class="color5">money</span></strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    In order of increasing saving requirements:
  </p>
  <ol>

    <li>Do you still have debts?

    <li>Do you have enough money to deal with an emergency?

    <li>Have you filled your tax-free savings account?

    <li>Do you want to reach financial independence?
    </li>
  </ol>

  <ul>

    <li>Investing — see: <a href="https://matiroy.com/writings/Consume-now-or-later.html">Consuming now or later?</a>

        Makes Sense</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>2021-11-16 Note:</strong></p>
  <p>If you care about reducing your suffering:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>(Probably?) Moving to a country with laws supportive of medical aid in dying (in case of forecasted incoming
      Hellish world)
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong class="color1">Exchanging money for time</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re working directly on a priority issue, consider outsourcing mundane tasks to have more time/energy for your
    work. <a href="https://matiroy.com/contact.html">Contact me</a> for help with this.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong class="color1">Other (added on 2021-11-16)</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Depending on your comparentive advantages, funding a startup or <a href="https://80000hours.org/">investing in your
      education</a> might be the most valuable.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong class="color4">Donating money for other reasons</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If at least one of those conditions is true:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>You’re wealthy and want to live much longer than our current lifespans

    <li>You want to cooperate with other life extensionists

    <li>Many of the people you love are interested in biostasis

    <li>(<strong>added on 2021-11-16</strong>) You want to help existing humans and have a death-focus ethic
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In order, I recommend donating to:
  </p>
  <ol>

    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.alcor.org/">Alcor</a>’s <a target="_blank"
        href="https://www.alcor.org/rapid/">Readiness And Procedure
        Innovation Deployment (“RAPID”)</a>

    <li>the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.brainpreservation.org/">Brain Preservation Foundation</a>’s <a
        target="_blank" href="https://www.brainpreservation.org/aspirational-neuroscience-prize/">Aspirational
        Neuroscience Prize</a>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <strong>Note</strong>: I actually recommend keeping the money as I might soon create a cryonics Patreon page, but
    I’m not sure whether I’m allowed to say this :)
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>2021-11-16 update</strong>:
  </p>
  <p>
    I now recommend keeping your money to fund a future biopreservation project.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to help existing humans and have a suffering-focus ethic, then I would focus on minimizing the
    probability of experiencing hellish worlds, so I look into researching the implication of <a
      href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zmsFfXFiS2fpA7xWs/what-information-on-or-relevant-to-modal-immortality-do-you">modal
      immortality</a>, legalizing medical aid in dying in your contry, and malign superintelligence forecasting (for the
    latter, I would suggest asking <a
      href="https://quantifieduncertainty.org/88710d8de8c1406782c131b1e6431680">Ozzie</a>.
  </p>

  <h2 class="color2">How to decide where to donate money for altruistic values?</h2>


  <p>
    I recommend reading <a target="_blank"
      href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KoJebRWH26DwkAhks/when-should-you-use-lotteries">When should you
      use lotteries?</a> before donating money, especially if you’re planning to dedicate less than 25% of your life to
    altruistic causes.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you haven’t spent at least a couple hundred hours reading about effective altruism at a high level, ie. moral
    philosophy, moral economics, comparing cause areas, etc., then I recommend saving that money to donate later as I
    think you will likely find ways to donate money that are many times more effective (I’m open to betting on that).
    Even if that means you end up spending 50% of your altruistic time budget on reading, and only 50% of
    earning-to-give, I still think it’s worth it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some of <a href="https://matiroy.com/readings.html">my reading recommendations on effective altruism</a>. I
    also recommend reading about <a target="_blank"
      href="https://causeprioritization.org/Donating_now_vs_later">Donating now vs
      later</a> (very roughly listed in order of importance).
  </p>
  <p>
    You could save the money in your personal account or in your personal Donor-Advised Fund. The former has the
    advantage of being able to donate to entities other than charities. The latter has the advantage of tax-deduction,
    and
    especially of not paying tax on interests from investments. Assuming 8% interest rate, and a 25% investment tax,
    this would mean doing 47x instead of 18x over 50 years — over 300 years, it would mean ~10G-x instead of ~40M-x: a
    difference of 250x. Also check out <a target="_blank"

  </p>
  <p>
    If you know people that share your values, and whom you trust their epistemology, and that have researched this
    question, you can ask them for / check out their recommendations. This might include looking at what prioritisation
    researchers recommend (ex.: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruism</a>, <a
      target="_blank" href="http://globalprioritiesproject.org/">Global Priorities Project</a>, <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity Institute</a>). But there’s part of the research that needs to
    be done by you to even be able to identify those people (ex.: by reading this post). Plus, it’s hard to be able to
    directly differentiate someone 5 steps further the <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/crucial-considerations-and-wise-philanthropy-nick-bostrom/">deliberation
      ladder</a> than you from someone 10 steps further. <strong>Note</strong>: I have ideas for systems to make that
    easier, and others have worked on this, but it’s a hard problem.

  <p>
    If you have more than 1M CAD to give away, you can receive personal guidance by the organisation <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.effectivegiving.org/">Effective Giving</a>. If you have more than 1B USD, I recommend reaching
    out to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openphilanthropy.org/">Open Philanthropy Project</a>. If you have a
    company and want
    to give part of your profit, I recommend reaching out to <a target="_blank"

      Pledge</a>.

  <h2 class="color2">Where to donate money for altruistic values?</h2>


  <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://founderspledge.com/research">Founders Pledge</a> is working on a <a target="_blank"
      href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8vfadjWWMDaZsqghq/long-term-investment-fund-at-founders-pledge">Long-term
      investment fund</a> that would give money in the future. See <a target="_blank"
      href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CfLoq8nJBzRARohtQ/the-case-for-investing-to-give-later">their case
      for investing to give later</a>. I would recommend reaching out to Sjir to ask zir how money-constraint that
    project is. Note: I don’t know what value system the fund will espouse exactly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Effective Altruism has a few very large donors, so it seems to me like the cause areas and organizations in which
    they are interested are pretty well funded. I would therefore recommend the following types of donation
    opportunities:
  </p>
  <ul>

    <li>Causes that are too weird / socially risky for most donors
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Note</strong>: You will probably not easily find those discussed publicly.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>Interventions that are very local
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Note</strong>: Those can be hard for large donors to spot. They might also be too expensive to
          evaluate, but if you already know the potential recipient, you might not need to spend additional effort to
          vet them.

        <li><strong>2021-11-16</strong>: To clarify, I mean help someone local to your network help the world globally,
          not directly helping someone locally (I definitely approve doing the latter, but I would categorize that as
          tribalism, not altruism).

        <li><strong>Examples</strong>: Say a small project or event by someone you know, flying a friend to an EA event,
          a YouTube channel / blog / patreon page on an important topic, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <li>If you’re working in a priority area that is complex to understand, then you might be aware of interventions
      that large donors aren’t aware of.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Otherwise, I would invest partly in a Donor-Advised Fund and partly in a personal account (see previous section for
    why).
  </p>
  <p>
    Other places that I think are good, in order of recommendation: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds">Effective Altruism Infrastructure Fund, Long-Term Future (X-risk in
      practice)</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://longtermrisk.org/grantmaking/">The Center on Long-Term Risk’s
      S-risk Fund</a>
    (note: the priority between the last two funds probably depends on your values). Those funds, really, are just a way
    to delegate the decision to people I think are in a good position to make it.
  </p>
  <p>
    I also think prizes are underexploited. If there’s a research problem you want to help solve, and ideally that has a
    success condition that can easily be determined, consider creating / funding a prize. It creates an economic
    incentive for solving the problem, and doesn’t require donors to themselves try to figure out what approaches and
    teams are most likely to succeed. I would notably like to see a prize for improving <a target="_blank"
      href="https://causeprioritization.org/Moral_economics">certificates of impact</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>2021-11-16 Notes:</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    While big organizations are usually well-funded (and I don’t just mean that by definition ^^) , donating will still
    be useful, and it might be meaningful and motivating for you, and be a good way to promote a rational approach to
    altruism to your peers, as donating money is a strong / costly signal of caring. If you subscribe to this line of
    thinking, then I would suggest donating to the <a href="https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/">Future of Humanity Institute</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>How to leverage your donation?</h2>


  <p>
    See: <a target="_blank"
      href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sodyrmPVGpr40E4sJt5vvQXc8ooQDVbA4NNzPNjn_J4/edit#">Notes for
      Canadian donors</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you’re a large donor, and not in Canada, you should probably make your own research to see how you can maximize
    your donations per dollar donated in your country.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Tax credits and deductions</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    If your preferred charity isn’t tax-deductible in your country, consider trading your donation with someone in
    another country. See how on EA Hub’s <a target="_blank" href="https://donationswap.eahub.org/">Donation Swap</a>
    page.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Cause-agnostic donation match</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Look out for donation matches that are not specific to a charity. There are often some during December; notably:
    Facebook (see: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eagivingtuesday.org/">Giving Tuesday</a>) and <a target="_blank"
      href="https://www.paypal.ca/giveback">PayPal</a>. <strong>2021-11-16 Note</strong>: They are often promoted on <a
      href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/</a>.
